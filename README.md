# Take-home assignment.

### Service Description:

Our frontend displays a weather widget that requests data from the server every 10 minutes. The average number of online users is 15,000 per hour.

### Current Solution Description:

The server-side application communicates with two third-party services:

* IP API - a service for determining geolocation by IP address
* Open Meteo - a service for obtaining weather information by geolocation.

The application is deployed in two instances.
Both instances share a single database.
* Environment (per instance):
    * CPU = 2 cores
    * RAM = 1GB
* Tech stack:
    * Java 17
    * Sping boot 3
    * PostgreSQL
    * Liquibase

### Problem:
Our Junior Developer created the server-side application, and it has some drawbacks.
Also, this morning we discovered that many calls to Open Meteo are failing with errors.
It has become very slow, inconsistent, and unreliable. Request times are unpredictable, and it fails with 5xx errors from time to time
We don't know what the problem is, possibly even with our proxy server.

But the DevOps team cannot help us in the next few days. We need a quick fix so that users don't suffer. The team discussed and decided to add caching for successful responses. When a request to Open Meteo fails with an error, we simply return the last saved result. At least this will reduce the number of errors.

### Conditions:
Without the DevOps team, we do not have access to the infrastructure.

The problem must be solved in the existing environment.

You can change the code as you like, use any libraries, and use the existing database.

### Task:
You need to perform several tasks:
1. Add caching for successful responses, read from cache when there are errors in the response.
2. Improve the existing code written by the Junior Developer.
3. Describe your opinion about the team's decision. Is it good, optimal, or bad? What decision could be better?

### How to run app
Use /docker/docker-compose.yaml to launch the database.

The application is written in JDK 17 and uses Preview Features. If you encounter the following error:
```
> Task :compileJava FAILED
error: invalid source release 17 with --enable-preview
  (preview language features are only supported for release 18)
```
Then check the following:
1. Gradle is running and using JDK 17.
2. In the project settings, the language level is set to 17 (Preview) - Pattern matching for switch.

If everything is set correctly, but you still receive the error, then pass the JDK path to the Gradle command.
```
./gradlew build -Dorg.gradle.java.home={PATH TO JDK 17}

Example: 
./gradlew test -Dorg.gradle.java.home=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-17.0.3.1.jdk/Contents/Home
```

### How to make request
1. GET http://localhost:8080/weather
2. Request should contain 2 headers:
    * X-Forwarded-For (your external IP address)
    * X-API-KEY (auth api key, default = `M2ZjNDZmOWItMzJmMC00YzhlLWE3ZTctNDY3YzQ2YzAzZjli`)
      Example:
```
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/weather' \
--header 'X-Forwarded-For: 81.198.20.21' \
--header 'X-API-KEY: M2ZjNDZmOWItMzJmMC00YzhlLWE3ZTctNDY3YzQ2YzAzZjli'
```
